2. BetterKitPvP w/redgabri
## EchoMC Practice
Italian practice server hosted in **Milan** to reduce your **latency** and **improve** your gaming experience.

## BetterKitPvP
A **KitPVP core** with lots of features, you also have the choice of being able to disable or enable some features inherent to a KitPvP server.
The plugin has been 100% **optimized** to give you the best experience.
BetterKitPvP has been programmed to make it easier for you to **work** on your server and to put as few plugins as possible, in order to **reduce** lag on your server!
**The plugin is currently unavailable, but will be released on BuiltByBit soon**!
